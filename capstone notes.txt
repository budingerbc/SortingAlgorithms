linear insertion - n^2, n-1 passes over data list
binary insertion - same idea as linear insertion but halves the data set continuously until all items are sorted, n log n, n^2 data movements
shellsort - performs linear insertion on evenly separated sets of data multiple times

bubblesort - compares two data values and 
shakersort - like bubble, but goes both ways across the data structure and 
quicksort - uses a pivot value, then finds an item larger and smaller and interchanges them

straight selection - finds the smallest value and moves it to the correct place
tree selection -
heap sort -
